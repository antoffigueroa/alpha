Heckman et al. 1990: observational evidence of outflows along the minor axis of
galaxies in the local universe.

Lehnert and Heckman 1996: excess of line emission along the minor axis of
galaxies in the local Universe. Lines are broader along the minor axis.

Bordoloi et al. 2011: studied azimuthal distribution of Mg II at <200 kpc of
~4000 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9. Found strong azimuthal dependence of Mg II
absorption.

Bouche et al 2012b: studied strong Mg II absorption system in the line of sight
of 12 QSOs. Azimuthal distribution is bimodal. Biconical outflow model is able
to reproduce the results.

Kacprzak et al. 2012: studied 88 Mg II absorption systems and 35 non-absorption
systems. Found absorption is preferently located along the minor and major
axes.

Martin et al. 2012: studied ~200 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Found a strong
correlation between Fe II velocity and azimuthal angle.

Bouche et al. 2013: inflows are located along the minor axis.

Bordoloi et al. 2014a: studied Mg II absorption using QSO absorption lines and
stacked spectra. Found a strong correlation between line strength and azimuthal
angle. Stronger absorbers are within 50ยบ of the minor axis.

Bordoloi et al. 2014b: studied 486 galaxies at 1 < z < 1.5. Found that face-on
galaxies show higher equivalent widths than edge-on galaxies.

Kacprzak et al. 2014: found evidence for an outflow along the minor axis of a
galaxy at z=0.2.

Lan et al. 2014: studied 2000 galaxy-absorber pairs at z~0.5. Found stronger
Mg II absorbers are located along the minor axis.

Mathes et al. 2014: studied 14 HI and O VI absorption systems. Found H I column
density is larger along the minor and major axes of galaxies, but O VI seemed
to be uniform.

Schroetter et al. 2015: observations of 10 QSO-galaxy pairs. Model that assumes
a biconical outflow along the minor axis is able to explain the observations.

Schroetter et al. 2016: found evidence for a biconical outflow in a single
galaxy using MUSE and UVES.

Kacprzak 2017: review. Relevant sections: 2.2, 4.

Nelson et al. 2019: simulations of outflows. Initially outflows have a wide
apperture angle, but then become collimated.

Schroetter et al. 2019: studied 79 strong Mg II absorbers. Found bimodal
distribution of Mg II equivalent width.

Lundgren et al. 2021: studied 54 Mg II absorbers at 0.64 < z < 1.4. Found
enhanced Mg II absorption within 50ยบ of the minor axis. Also calculated a model
for equivalent width distribution that takes into consideration azimuthal angle,
impact parameter and environment.
