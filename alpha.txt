Bordoloi et al. 2011: studied azimuthal distribution of Mg II at <200 kpc of
~4000 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9. Found strong azimuthal dependence of Mg II
absorption.

Kacprzak et al. 2012: studied 88 Mg II absorption systems and 35 non-absorption
systems. Found absorption is preferently located along the minor and major
axes.

Martin et al. 2012: studied ~200 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Found a strong
correlation between Fe II velocity and azimuthal angle.

Mathes et al. 2014: studied 14 HI and O VI absorption systems. Found H I column
density is larger along the minor and major axes of galaxies, but O VI seemed
to be uniform.
