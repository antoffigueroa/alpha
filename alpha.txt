Bordoloi et al. 2011: studied azimuthal distribution of Mg II at <200 kpc of
~4000 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 0.9. Found strong azimuthal dependence of Mg II
absorption.

Bouche et al 2012b: studied strong Mg II absorption system in the line of sight
of 12 QSOs. Azimuthal distribution is bimodal. Biconical outflow model is abble
to reproduce the results.

Kacprzak et al. 2012: studied 88 Mg II absorption systems and 35 non-absorption
systems. Found absorption is preferently located along the minor and major
axes.

Martin et al. 2012: studied ~200 galaxies at 0.4 < z < 1.4. Found a strong
correlation between Fe II velocity and azimuthal angle.

Mathes et al. 2014: studied 14 HI and O VI absorption systems. Found H I column
density is larger along the minor and major axes of galaxies, but O VI seemed
to be uniform.

Schroetter et al. 2015: observations of 10 QSO-galaxy pairs. Model that assumes
a biconical outflow along the minor axis is able to explain the observations.

Kacprzak 2017: review. Relevant sections: 2.2, 4.

Lundgren et al. 2021: studied 54 Mg II absorbers at 0.64 < z < 1.4. Found
enhanced Mg II absorption within 50ยบ of the minor axis. Also calculated a model
for equivalent width distribution that takes into consideration azimuthal angle,
impact parameter and environment.
